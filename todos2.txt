ideas:
- save filter states with mini screenshots? like collectibles in a "backpack" or inventory
- "guild hall" where users post/upvote insightful views

- base filter sliders presets on reported grades? to create a profile for students? like a "suggestions" button

------------------------------------------
todos
- subtle dropdown axes?
- 50% line for automation risk
- ask users "what information do you care about in making a career decision?" to determine views
- fix 'movebottomdown'
***********************************

current:

- unjam filters in tutorial3

- add pretty force simulation for equal size circles
- read 'getting real' & learn ruby & rails
- sketch 2 tutorial designs for criticisms


- wage -- > salary: include low, med, high
	- annotate salary: 40k
big:
- sketch specific more/less/fewer decorateYAxis(mode)  per graph mode
- map annotations over colour split or otherwise fix the legend/split overlap

small
- annotate split view
- embiggen reset button
- remove suggested views minimize button?
big
save button
- save filter states with mini screenshots
tutorial
 - sketch a mock-up before changing!
- more hand-holding, third-person use-case


***********************************
- bug: circles move down slightly after graphmodeoff
- fix circle graph x position
- search button to filter button?

next steps:
- note "tutorial x/4" on tutorial pages
- filter button instead of search, separate search page

- click color legend to filter industries
	- transparencies for on/off
- move split button to color legend

- filter from both sides
- fix filter algorithm:
	- only language skills?
	- determine why some circles are filtering to invisible

content list?

scrape pictures for each job

pick one
- bug: filters leaving holes

- lengthen or explain graph views sentences
- graph view tooltip positions
- graph view first-time intro div
- graph view
 add 1 more view for testing (dropdown?)
 add view sectioning

next:
- same size initially?
- transition sliders on reset
- remove capitalization from axis titles
- annotate views
	- vertical/horizontal dividers and x-y section names
	- highlighted areas?
- hide pause button?

- about, help, feedback pages

- make graph view y axis responsive

- add all tooltips to tutorial
	- page 2 & 3 circle tooltips
	- page 3 slider tooltips

- switch sliders to dragstarted instead of on drag (to prevent mouseout from ending the drag -- interrupt?)

-'about' page content

- flash when slider under 10 jobs?
	- change the background colour of the screen?

- create mobile layout (<=640px)
  - reposition sliders below circles
  - combine all buttons above circles

- colour and size legend btnlegend btnsizes mouseover is twitchy, disable mouseover for .5 sec before reenabling pointer events?

- check filter algorithm for possible speed improvements using "continue" (next loop) and "break" (end loop) -- should be able to run on a chromebook

- bug: tooltips not disappearing on mouseout (when? after click-on, click-elsewhere e.g. button)
- bug: reset filters not working (when?)
- bug: subskill sliders cut off at medium resolution
- tutorial3: remove "prev" buttons?

- split button summary statistics for industries

- create slider inset shadow
- speed up all? transitions

- enclosure diagram containing split view? like on http://charts.vismio.com/9lqjn/

- move div instead of shrinking on tooltipclose (to avoid contents floating out)

- improve "job titles" and link top titles to search results

- turn mini skillbars into tooltiplarge skillbars

- Mute Split/Shuffle/Combine features when Graph view is enabled

- switch skill bars to relative scale?

- slow down or emphasize "pop" animation

- start tutorial with equal sizes & change size to Number of Jobs (how easy is it to get each job?)

- dropup fix double-click to single-click

- "language skills" is ambiguous

- add pause hover explainer div
- add suggested views explainer divs

- Explain why “lots” of skill = fewer job suggestions in tutorial

- "job type" instead of "job group"
- enable minimal (title-only) tooltips on tutorial3

- graph view suggested view walkthroughs, zones on graph

- place tooltip touching circle:
	-position buttons on top,
	-allow mouseovers through tooltip divs

- explainer divs glitchy switching between each other

- mobile version
	-ontouch instead of onclick
		-buttons: on first touch, open explainer div
			on second touch, activate
	-stack filters below break point
- graphmodeoff post-filtering reset simulation
- tooltip off in graph mode (switch sides to further outside)
- a more fun colour legend
- save button
- tooltip bottomdiv height too big
- tooltip divs don't fade-out on mouseout
- future mode axis & positions

explainer divs need to come in from the top right, transition their bottoms

mouseenter / mouseleave vs mouveover mouseout

-normalize skill bars & minibars

- change minibar colours to visible (grey-green? for invisible ones only)
-bug: clickspan not disappearing

- resize future view? y/n

- collapse navbar at the lg breakpoint
- collapse search bar to search icon

- search not working
- buttons not on top

-bug: tooltip doesn't re-furl after clicking in out-zone to remove it

- reset filters on tutorial 3?

mobile version = vh instead of vw

Tutorial on HOME PAGE and different tutorial pages WOW

graph mode = move all sliders out to sides

bug: compress graph vertically and movebottomdown/up less
bug: top right div not aligned?
bug: colour legend not aligned?
	- use position: absolute

- append skill bars inside tooltip div with position bottom
 - multiply tooltip padding x 1.5

- hover div on question marks

- mobile setup & other sizes

- create github readme.md

- think about slider-subslider interactions

- tooltip div side always on-screen (based on mouse location)

- colour legend button

- dropdown x and y selectors

- subslider divs expand from width&height = expand button dimensions

- move notmuchlots

- move industry split circles up a bit

- maybe move the sliders in from the sides? start by putting them all together for mobile

put language, buttons, logic into 3 4-inlines in a row 12-grid

- colour current suggested view button background & disable click

- pause-play in graph mode needs to stay in graph mode;

pause then reset needs to stay paused
(simulation restart if play mode on)

- filtering on graph view + future view needs to keep future colours on

- future view circles don't un-highlight

- hover info button tooltip

- Pave title = refresh button

- graph view off = back to industry split, legend needs to be reset to industry split legend

- combine button disappeared when coming out of graph view (on industry split)

- combine / split / shuffle in a box of four with views
& combine Size & Colour buttons in a row

- colour button which pops up the legend

- Pause button says "Pause" onhover = (for slow connections)"
	- switch to "stop" so the simulation never starts again

- make combine buttons unclickable but translucent in graph/future view

- filtered, then turned off graph view: force simulation needs reset

- append subsliders to the div instead of the chart

- set viewbox / circles height based on height/width ratio

- bug: showlogic not hidelegend-ing

- subskill dropdowns -- math & logic (switch position: absolute; right: some%)

- mobile: stretch distance between sliders based on window width


- smooth hide "combine" on graph and future modes

- bug: mouse-off of sliders while dragging stops dragging -- potential fix: on dragstarted, keep id constant, let go on dragended

- cleaning code to css

- subskill slider function
- subskill slider white background

- mini-bars to display on hover tooltip

- fix bars: append a 2nd div to click tooltip with bars
(can get fancy w the design)

- look up refactoring

- joyride style

- job titles search (within job groups)

- bug: tiny empty job in right side under purple group

- mobile compatibility
- mobile sliders sizes

- mobile tooltip on touch

- favourite toggle

- bug: skills bar chart height on longer tooltips

- responsive design for the canvas:
 - resize works, but viz starts too big on small windows
sliderSVGArray[i].append("g") // switch to SVG with viewBox?

- responsive design for the sliders

- legend for future mode


Other todos:

- combine button fun physics atom-smasher???
